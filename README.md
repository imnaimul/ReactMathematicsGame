# ReactMultiplicationGame

 This is a simple game I created when I was learning React. It was a great project to get my hands dirty with the React Basics.
 
## Setup

* Clone repository using " git clone https://github.com/imnaimul/ReactMultiplicationGame.git " 
* Run "npm install" to get all the dependency installed 
* Run "npm run dev-server" to server the project on your local machine.
* Head over to "http://localhost:8080"
